# Hands-on Machine Learning: Train Your First Model

## Overview
This repository contains materials from the **"Hands-on Machine Learning: Train Your First Model"** workshop. The workshop was designed to introduce participants to the fundamentals of Machine Learning (ML), focusing on model training using the Titanic dataset. This workshop was conducted by **[Syed M. Aaliyan Tarique](https://github.com/smaaliyan)** at **Aptech North Nazimabad Campus**.

## Objectives
- Introduction to Machine Learning and its types
- Real-world examples of Machine Learning applications
- Data collection and its resources
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Training a machine learning model
- Evaluating model performance

## Dataset Used
The workshop utilizes the **Titanic dataset**, a well-known dataset for binary classification tasks, sourced from Kaggle.

## Topics Covered
1. **What is Machine Learning?**  
   - Definition and key concepts  
   - Types of Machine Learning (Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement Learning)  
   - Real-world applications
2. **Data Collection & Sources**  
   - Where to find datasets  
   - Kaggle and other ML resources
3. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Feature engineering
4. **Model Training**  
   - Selecting a suitable algorithm  
   - Implementing the model using Python (Scikit-learn)
5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy metrics  
   - Improving performance

## Workshop Notebook
The Jupyter Notebook included in this repository provides a step-by-step guide covering data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. You can access and run the notebook in Google Colab for easy execution.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed with the necessary libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### Running the Notebook
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smaaliyan/ml-workshop.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd ml-workshop
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook workshop_notebook.ipynb
   ```

Alternatively, upload the notebook to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and run it there.
